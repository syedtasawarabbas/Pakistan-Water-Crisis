💧 Save Water, Save Lives: Pakistan Water Crisis Dashboard
DataFest 2025 Project | Theme: "Number to Lives - Turning Complex Data into Insightful Stories"

📖 Overview
Save Water, Save Lives is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to visualize Pakistan's critical water security and sanitation challenges. By transforming 20 years of complex World Bank data into accessible, interactive stories, this project aims to bridge the gap between raw statistics and public awareness.
This project was developed for the DataFest 2025 competition, specifically targeting the Data Science track to demonstrate how data visualization can drive policy change and personal responsibility (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation).

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes trends in drinking water vs. sanitation access (2000-2022).
Regional Benchmarking: Compares Pakistan's water stress levels against neighboring countries (India, China, Bangladesh, etc.).
Sector Analysis: Breaks down water consumption by Agriculture, Industry, and Domestic use.
Water Footprint Calculator: An interactive tool that engages users to calculate their personal water usage and impact.
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.

📊 Key Insights (The "Number to Lives" Story)
Our analysis of the World Bank data reveals three critical narratives:
1. The Sanitation Gap (Public Health Crisis)
While Pakistan has achieved over 90% access to drinking water, sanitation services lag significantly behind at roughly 60%. This "gap" represents millions of citizens exposed to water-borne diseases, highlighting an urgent need for infrastructure investment.

2. The Pressure Cooker (Water Stress)
Pakistan faces a water stress level of ~116%, meaning the country withdraws more freshwater annually than its renewable resources can replenish. This is one of the highest rates in the region, signaling a critical dependency on depleting groundwater reserves.

3. The Agricultural Reality
91.9% of Pakistan's water usage goes to agriculture. This insight directs policy focus towards efficient irrigation (like drip systems) rather than just domestic conservation alone.
