# 💧Save Water, Save Lives: Pakistan Water Crisis Dashboard  
DataFest 2025 Project | Theme: "Number to Lives - Turning Complex Data into Insightful Stories"

---

## Overview
Save Water, Save Lives is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to visualize Pakistan's critical water security and sanitation challenges.  
By transforming 20 years of World Bank data into accessible, interactive insights, this project bridges the gap between raw statistics and public awareness.

This project was developed for the DataFest 2025 competition (Data Science Track) to demonstrate how meaningful data visualization can support policy change, national planning, and responsible water usage.  
Aligned with SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

## Key Features
- Interactive dashboard visualizing drinking water and sanitation trends (2000–2022).  
- Regional benchmarking comparing Pakistan's water stress with neighboring countries.  
- Sector-wise breakdown of water usage: Agriculture, Industry, Domestic.  
- Water Footprint Calculator enabling users to estimate their personal water consumption.  
- Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## Key Insights (Number to Lives Narrative)

### 1. The Sanitation Gap  
Pakistan maintains high drinking water access (90%+), but sanitation access remains around 60%.  
This gap exposes millions to water-borne diseases, signaling an urgent need for sanitation infrastructure development.

### 2. The Pressure Cooker  
Pakistan faces water stress levels of approximately 116%, meaning national water withdrawals exceed renewable supply.  
This high pressure indicates dependence on diminishing groundwater reserves.

### 3. The Agricultural Reality  
Approximately 91.9% of Pakistan’s water consumption is driven by agriculture.  
This insight highlights the need for efficient irrigation systems to reduce waste and improve sustainability.
